Purpose of Data Processing.

Subscription Management: Verifying subscription status and providing access to additional features or content.

Token Tracking and Deduction: Monitoring the number of tokens available to the user and deducting them when used.

No Other Personal Data. We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, payment details, or any other information that could identify the user. Payment transactions and user identification are handled by third-party platforms (such as Google Play, App Store) and the RevenueCat service.

We use the RevenueCat service (hereinafter referred to as the “Service”) to manage subscriptions. This Service may receive limited technical information about the user’s device or behavior to verify payments and maintain proper subscription operations. We do not transfer any additional personal data to RevenueCat other than the necessary technical identifiers.
